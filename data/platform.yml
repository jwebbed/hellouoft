  - title: Hello to a new UTSU
    point: How can we make next year about giving the students’ union back to students? How can we prove that the UTSU is actually here to serve you? We promise a complete overhaul of the UTSU’s online presence, including a revamped, easy-to-navigate website that will allow you to track everything that the UTSU does—including our progress towards our goals. We’ll use our homepage to promote events—club events as well as UTSU events—and to keep you up to date on what’s happening in the U of T community. You’ll also be able to follow us by watching monthly video updates featuring Executives and members of the Board. It’s the UTSU’s job to make sure that you know what deadlines are approaching, what events are coming, and more.\n\nIn the past, students were told that it was their responsibility to get involved with the UTSU. That was wrong. The UTSU needs to make itself more accessible—that’s what giving the students’ union back to students is about.

  - title: Hello to Queen’s Park and Parliament Hill
    point: Students voted in record numbers last October, and we now have a government that claims to be committed to listening to student voices. We need to take advantage of this commitment and, together with other students’ unions, lobby the new government directly—we need to ensure that U of T voices are heard. We also need to lobby the provincial government. The announcement of free tuition for students from families making less than $50,000 is a great start, but there’s more work to be done. The caps on annual fee increases are set to expire in 2017, and the universities will push to have them raised. We need to freeze and lower them. Fees are already allowed to rise faster than the rate of inflation, and it’s only to get worse if we don’t start working now. Queen’s Park is right across the street—we will meet with MPPs regularly to ensure that student voices don’t get drowned out by the universities.

  - title: Hello to mental wellness
    point: "With the addition of psychotherapy coverage—of up to $100 per session—to the UTSU Health Plan, it’s time to show U of T how important mental health really is. The goal can only be full coverage of mental health services for all students. We will continue to expand the Health Plan, but we also need to force the University to take responsibility for the mental health of its students. We will work with Student Life to create a clear, accessible guide to the resources that the University offers, and we will ensure that this guide is available in multiple languages. In order eliminate the stigma attached to mental illness, we will provide self-care resources and peer-to-peer counselling services, and we will work with faculties and departments to ensure that these mental health resources are promoted on every syllabus. Self-care is a priority for us: Peer-to-peer counselling will provide students with a safe, confidential space where they can destress and heal.\n\nToo many instructors don’t see mental illness as a legitimate reason for missing class, so we’ll push for an excused absence system based on the McMaster Student Absence Form, which allows each student to miss up to three days of class per term, for any medical reason—no matter what the instructor thinks. We need this at U of T."

  - title: Hello to clubs
    point: Whether a sports, arts or culture club, these groups form the core of campus life. The UTSU funds over 100 of these clubs. However the funding process is bureaucratic and makes for slow turnaround. Bringing funding application online will get well-deserved money to clubs sooner!\n\nEvery time a club uses AV equipment in a classroom it costs money! We can save valuable time and money by using sharing economies. Instead of each club purchasing AV equipment, furniture or electronics, they can borrow it from a resource bank sponsored by the UTSU freeing up more club money for events and making for a richer campus life.\n\nWe want to encourage as much awareness and participation in campus life as possible. By creating a user friendly and personalizable platform to help students get and stay involved on campus. We think students should be able to filter to see the events that interest them, know about club meetings and of course, know where the free food on campus is at any point.

  - title: Hello to your campuses
    point: Figuring out the best places to eat and study (and nap!) at U of T takes time. As we prepare for the opening of the long-awaited Student Commons in fall 2017, we want to expand on the space that’s available to students. U of T is a commuter school—80% of students are commuters—but our student spaces aren’t very commuter-friendly. Wouldn’t a student-only nap room be nice? UBC did it, so we can do it, too. We also need to do something about the food options—on both campuses. Starting next year, U of T will take over all St George food services, so we’ll have more direct access to the people who decide what is and isn’t available. We’ll use this opportunity to get better, healthier food, including halal, kosher, and vegetarian options. If that’s not enough, it’s time for students to vote on what on what the UTSU should do. When it comes to events and services, we want to hear from you.
