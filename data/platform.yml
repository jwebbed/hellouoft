  - title: A new UTSU
    point: "<strong>How can we make next year about giving the students’ union back to students?</strong> How can we prove that the UTSU is actually here to serve you? We promise a <strong>complete overhaul of the UTSU’s online presence</strong>, including a <strong>revamped, easy-to-navigate website</strong> that will allow you to track everything that the UTSU does—including our progress towards our goals. We’ll use our homepage to promote events—club events as well as UTSU events—and to keep you up to date on what’s happening in the U of T community. You’ll also be able to follow us by watching monthly video updates featuring Executives and members of the Board. It’s the UTSU’s job to make sure that you know what deadlines are approaching, what events are coming, and more.\n\nIn the past, students were told that it was their responsibility to get involved with the UTSU. That was wrong. The UTSU needs to make itself more accessible—that’s what giving the students’ union back to students is about."

  - title: Queen’s Park and Parliament Hill
    point: "Students voted in record numbers last October, and we now have a government that claims to be committed to listening to student voices. We need to take advantage of this commitment and, together with other students’ unions, lobby the new government directly—we need to ensure that <strong>U of T voices are heard.</strong> We also need to lobby the provincial government. The announcement of <strong>free tuition for students from families making less than $50,000</strong> is a great start, but there’s more work to be done. The caps on annual fee increases are set to expire in 2017, and the universities will push to have them raised. We need to <strong>freeze and lower them.</strong> Fees are already allowed to rise faster than the rate of inflation, and it’s only going to get worse if we don’t start working now. <strong>Queen’s Park is right across the street</strong>—we will meet with MPPs regularly to ensure that <strong>student voices don’t get drowned out by the universities.</strong>\n\nLobbying isn’t just about slogans--we believe in setting tangible, achievable goals that we can actually accomplish. Education is a right, but we need a short-term plan, too. Right now, we need to focus on 2017, because deregulation would be a disaster."

  - title: Comprehensive Sexual Violence Policy
    point: "Despite the best efforts of the students who advised on it, the new University policy on sexual violence is <strong>not good enough.</strong> It no longer states that </strong>students have a right to feel safe on campus</strong>, and, because students only have a right to be consulted when the policy is reviewed three years from now, there is no guarantee that it will be changed or replaced if it fails to meet our needs. At least half of the members of any review committee should be students.\n\nWe’ll lobby the University to hire a diverse team of sexual violence counsellors—there’s currently only one for all three campuses—and implement consistent consent programming, because one presentation during Frosh Week isn’t enough. Information about sexual violence resources should be <strong>included on every syllabus.</strong>"
    
  - title: Mental wellness
    point: "With the addition of psychotherapy coverage—of up to $100 per session—to the UTSU Health Plan, it’s time to <strong>show U of T how important mental health really is.</strong> The is clear & simple: full coverage of mental health services for all students. We will continue to expand the Health Plan, but we also need to force the University to take responsibility for the mental health of its students. We will work with Student Life to create a <strong>clear, accessible guide</strong> to the resources that the University offers, and we will ensure that this guide is available in <strong>multiple languages.</strong> In order <strong>eliminate the stigma attached to mental illness</strong>, we will provide self-care resources and peer-to-peer counselling services, and we will work with faculties and departments to ensure that these <strong>mental health resources are promoted on every syllabus.</strong> Self-care is a priority for us: Peer-to-peer counselling will provide students with a safe, confidential space where they can destress and heal. Next year, we will have a <strong>Mental Wellness Commissioner</strong>--a new position--responsible for overseeing all of our mental wellness initiatives.\n\nToo many instructors don’t see mental illness as a legitimate reason for missing class, so we’ll push for an <strong>excused absence system</strong> based on the McMaster Student Absence Form, which allows each student to miss up to three days of class per term, for any medical reason—no matter what the instructor thinks. <strong>We need to see this at U of T.</strong>"

  - title: Effective activism
    point: "We acknowledge the truth of systemic inequality in our society and at our University. All student leaders have the responsibility to be <strong>better activists and better allies</strong>, broadening social discourse to include the voices of those most adversely affected by the forces of marginalization--those who have for too long gone unheard. We are committed to <strong>fostering a culture of allyship on campus.</strong> We believe that the UTSU should <strong>make resources easily available</strong> to those seeking to combat systemic oppression, including--but not limited to--anti-Black racism, transphobia, Islamophobia, queerphobia, and ableism based on non-visible as well as visible disabilities.\n\nWe pledge to <strong>continue the work of the Racialized Students’ Collective,</strong> in order to open up a safe space in which intersectional discussion is prioritized. We will <strong>actively lobby the University to divest from states and businesses that engage in the systematic violation of human rights</strong>, including, but not limited to, Israel and ExxonMobil. We will support student activists through the restructured Social Justice and Equity Commission and the seven Equity Directors who have joined the Board. <strong>The UTSU must be both an activist and an ally.</strong> More importantly, it must know when to lead, and when to step back and lend support."

  - title: Clubs
    point: "<strong>Clubs are the lifeblood of campus life at U of T</strong>, and the UTSU funds hundreds of them. However, the funding application process is an excessively bureaucratic, cumbersome mess. It involves far too much paperwork, and it can take months for clubs to get their funding. We’ll <strong>move the application system online</strong>, so that you get your funding earlier! Also, renting equipment from ACE costs money, so the UTSU should make it possible for clubs to <strong>pool the resources that they already have.</strong>\n\nWe want to encourage clubs to work with the UTSU and with each other, and to participate in campus life as much as possible. We’ll achieve this by allowing clubs to promote themselves and their events through our <strong>revamped online platforms.</strong>"

  - title: Your campuses
    point: "Figuring out the best places to eat and study (and nap!) at U of T takes time. As we prepare for the <strong>opening of the long-awaited Student Commons in fall 2017</strong>, we want to expand on the space that’s available to students. U of T is a commuter school—80% of students are commuters—but our student spaces aren’t very commuter-friendly. <strong>Wouldn’t a student-only nap room be nice?</strong> UBC did it, so we can do it, too. We also need to do something about the food options—on both campuses. Starting next year, U of T will take over all St George food services, so we’ll have more direct access to the people who decide what is and isn’t available. We’ll use this opportunity to get <strong>better, healthier food</strong>, including more halal, kosher, and vegetarian options. If that’s not enough, it’s time for students to <strong>vote</strong> on what on what the UTSU should do. When it comes to events and services, we want to hear from you, so we’ll start the year by sending you a <strong>comprehensive student survey.</strong>\n\nBut what about when your campus doesn’t <strong>feel</strong> like your campus? Like when it’s buried under two feet of snow, and U of T is the only university in southern Ontario that’s still open? U of T needs a clear <strong>snow day policy</strong> that isn’t “Snow? What snow?” We might not be able to eliminate winter, but we can keep you safe from it (sometimes). Lastly, we’ll work with campus groups to do an <strong>accessibility audit of every building</strong> at U of T."

  - title: Ultimate Transparency
    point: "We want to ensure that, when we communicate with our members, things are as clear as possible. Our Board meetings go on for hours, and reading through hundreds of pages of minutes that are loaded with inaccessible jargon is extremely tedious. We pledge to produce a <strong>one-minute summary</strong> of each Board meeting, so that you can stay up-to-date without giving up valuable study time—understanding what your students’ union is doing shouldn’t be a chore. We’ll also implement livestreaming of Board meetings, so that you can follow along without spending hours in a humid room at OISE. </strong>Your Executives will be more accessible, too:</strong> All of us will have weekly walk-in hours, so that you can talk to us more easily.\n\nRight now, Commissions are weighed down by procedure—we’ll change that. We’ve already gotten rid of the requirement that Commissions take formal minutes, but that’s just the start. The goal is to make Commissions <strong>action-focused hubs of activism.</strong> If you’re a student and you have an initiative, bring it to a Commission and get the UTSU to support it."

  - title: Saving You Money
    point: "We’ll <strong>freeze</strong> Executive salaries for one year and use the money saved to create a needs-based <strong>exam deferral bursary</strong> (Executive salaries are indexed to CPI, so they increase every year). If you need to defer an exam, the Faculty of Arts and Science charges you $70 per exam. This is wrong, and the bursary will provide a temporary solution while we lobby the Faculty to <strong>eliminate the fee entirely</strong>—as was done at the Faculty of Engineering."
