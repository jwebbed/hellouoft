Hi, I’m BEN COLEMAN, a fourth-year student from New College, running for President. As Arts and Science Director of the UTSU two years ago, I showed that UofT was making money charging interest to students on OSAP, and I want to continue working so that everyone can afford to come to UofT.  This year as a student Governor, I’ve pushed for UofT to improve how it helps victims of sexual violence and students struggling with mental health–issues that I will prioritize as President.  Your student union should do more for you, so for real change, vote for a BRIGHTER UofT.
